This repository contains the code associated with the paper submitted for consideration to Nature Machine Intelligence. All the collected code depends on publicly available libraries. Below are the links to the main dependencies used:

- [adam](https://github.com/ami-iit/adam)
- [shared controllers](https://github.com/ami-iit/shared-controllers) 

In this repository, we collect the scripts implemented for the results presented in the paper.


## First Architecture Instance: Optimal Hardware

This section includes the scripts required to replicate the hardware optimization performed for the ergoCub robot.

### Dependencies
- The optimization process depends on [adam](https://github.com/ami-iit/adam), which implements the core functionalities.

### Contents
- The scripts for hardware optimization.
- The output models from the optimization process, collected in this folder.

## Second Architecture Instance: Physical Intelligence

This section includes the scripts required to replicate the human-robot interaction experiments.

### Dependencies
- The code relies on the [shared controllers](https://github.com/ami-iit/shared-controllers) library, which implements the main functionalities.

### Contents
- The scripts for human-robot interaction experiments.

For further details on usage and implementation, please refer to the respective script documentation within each folder.
